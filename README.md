Phenopackets on FHIR
==================

This FHIR implementation guide has been produced as part of the [GA4GH](https://ga4gh.org) [Clinical Phenotype Data Capture Workstream](https://ga4gh-cp.github.io/).

It is based on the [Phenopackets standard](https://phenopackets-schema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), the [mCODE FHIR implementation guide](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/mcode/2019Sep/) and the [Clinical Genomics Reporting FHIR implementation guide](http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/).

Documentation
=============

This project contains the source code for the implementation guide. The website generate from this project can be found [here](https://genomics.ontoserver.csiro.au/phenopackets/).

Building
=================

The `build.sh` script builds the implementation guide locally. It expects an R4 local terminology server running at `localhost:8080/fhir`.
