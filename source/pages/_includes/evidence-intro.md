This element intends to represent the evidence for an assertion such as an observation of a PhenotypicFeature. We recommend the use of terms from the Evidence & Conclusion Ontology (ECO).

#### Mapping Notes

This element is modelled as a complex extension that includes an [external reference](StructureDefinition-external-reference.html) attribute. The FHIR implementation also binds the _evidenceCode_ attribute to the value set that represents the Evidence & Conclusion Ontology with a strength of _preferred_.
