This element is a list of ontology class elements that can be empty or contain one or more ontology terms that are intended to provide more expressive or precise descriptions of a phenotypic feature, including attributes such as positionality and external factors that tend to trigger or ameliorate the feature. Terms can be taken from the hierarchy of Clinical modifier in the HPO (noting that severity should be coded in the severity element).
