    "description": "Codes representing the structure, arrangement, and behavioral characteristics of tumors and cancer cells. Codes are preferrably taken from the SNOMED CT hierarchy under 367651003 (Malignant neoplasm of primary, secondary, or uncertain origin (morphologic abnormality)). ICD-O-3 morphology codes (including behavior suffix) can also be used, although they are not included in the value set for intellectual property reasons. For primary cancers, the ICD-O-3 behavior suffix should be /1, /2, or /3. For secondary cancers, the ICD-O-3 behavior suffix should be /6. Only SNOMED CT and ICD-O-3 are considered conformant to the specification.",
