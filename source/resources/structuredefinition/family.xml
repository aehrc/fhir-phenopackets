  <description value="Phenotype, sample and pedigree data required for a genomic diagnosis. This element is equivalent to the Genomics England InterpretationRequestRD. In many cases, genetic diagnostics of Mendelian and other disease is performed on a family basis in order to check for cosegregation of candidate variants with a disease. Usually, one family member is designated as the proband, for instance, a child affected by a genetic disease might be the proband in a family. Genomic diagnostics might involve genome sequencing of the child and his or her parents. In this case, the Family element would include a Phenopacket for the child (proband element). If the parents themselves display phenotypic findings relevant to the analysis, then Phenopackets are included for them (using the relatives element). If the parents do not display any relevant phenotypic findings, then it is not necessary to include Phenopacket elements for them. Instead, their status as unaffected can be recorded with the Pedigree element." />
