  <description value="This element is used to represent a pedigree file (PRD file). A PED file (“pedigree file”) describes the family relationships of each sample along with their gender and phenotype. PED files are typically used by software for genetic linkage analysis. PED files have six mandatory columns, and additional optional columns (that are typically not used in the context of genomic analysis). This message represents the core Ped file information that is used by many programs for analysis of a multi-sample VCF file with exome or genome sequences of members of a family, some of whom are affected by a Mendelian disease." />
