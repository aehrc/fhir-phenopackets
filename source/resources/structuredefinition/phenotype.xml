  <description value="This element is intended to be used to describe a phenotype that characterizes the subject of the Phenopacket. For medical use cases the subject will generally be a patient or a proband of a study, and the phenotypes will be abnormalities described by an ontology such as the Human Phenotype Ontology. The word phenotype is used with many different meanings including disease entity, but in this context we mean an individual phenotypic feature, observed as either present or absent (negated), with possible onset, modifiers and frequency." />
